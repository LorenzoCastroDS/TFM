1. The user shall assure it has an environment which has streamlit installed

2. Once necessary packages has been downloaded (streamlit and potly) the user must assure as well 
that the location of the frontend code must be the same as the location of df_stream.pkl, 
which holds the data from FD001 to be used in this visualization.

3. If the user has set up this correctly, there should be no issue when simply running the cells in the notebook,
the first one runs the code and the second launched the app.

4. If the app has been launched correctly, just have fun!
